This car is the first robot I ever build. Inspired by the Raspberry Pi and the site of Dawn Robotics [http://www.dawnrobotics.co.uk/] the building started. Without a cause, without a plan, just exploring.
I found my epic at [http://roboticssamy.blogspot.nl/] ( A balancing robot, reading signs and following lines by vision)
Since then I'm creating modules, building up the whole logical flow. 
If and when I learn how to put pictures and/or presentations in github, I submit the informational docs
In the mean time: if you find anything usefull, please help your self!
If you can help me out with structuring my linear scripts, I would be more than obliged with a pull request ;-0)
