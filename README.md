This car is the first robot I ever build. Inspired by the Raspberry Pi and the site of Dawn Robotics [http://www.dawnrobotics.co.uk/] the building started. Without a cause, without a plan, just exploring.
I found my epic at [http://roboticssamy.blogspot.nl/] ( A balancing robot, reading signs and following lines by vision)
Since then I'm creating modules, building up the whole logical flow. 
If and when I learn how to put pictures and/or presentations in github, I submit the informational docs
In the mean time: if you find anything usefull, please help your self!
If you can help me out with structuring my linear scripts, I would be more than obliged with a pull request ;-0)

Learned a lot (and fast) by the excellent tutorials of Adrian Rosebrock at http://www.pyimagesearch.com !!

I experienced the importance of the light settings. It is about homgeneous light: no direct lightning on the signs, no shades (or fully in shade). I'm still figuring out how to change the Auto Whithe Balance and or Dynamic Range of the camera while using the Dawn classes.
